# E-Commerce Sales Chatbot

An intelligent chatbot for e-commerce applications, built using the **Microsoft Bot Framework**. It helps users search for products, explore categories, and simulate shopping cart actions using cognitive services like LUIS, Azure Search, and Text Analytics.

This bot demonstrates how conversational AI can enhance the shopping experience through natural language interactions.

## üîß Project Updates

- Updated to use **Moltin v2 API** for generating search indexes.
- Transitioned from **Restify to Express** for improved performance and middleware flexibility.
- LUIS model upgraded to schema version 2.1.0.
- Temporarily removed Recommendations API due to deprecation by Microsoft. Logic still exists in code and can be re-enabled once supported.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This bot still uses Microsoft‚Äôs original **State API**, which is deprecated but functional. For production use, it's recommended to switch to [custom state storage using CosmosDB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/nodejs/bot-builder-nodejs-state-azure-cosmosdb).
